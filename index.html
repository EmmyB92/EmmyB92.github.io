<h2>Who I am</h2>
	<p class="intro"> I am a designer whose mission it is to re-design the world! Or at least as many parts of it that I can get my hands on.</p>

	<dt>Why Design?</dt>
	<dd>The world as we know it wouldn't exist today without design. As designers we do more than make stuff look pretty. We are visual communicators, dynamic thinkers, problem solvers, and creative geniuses.</dd>

	<dt>My Mission</dt>
	<dd>It is my goal in this lifetime to reach and inspire as many people as possible all across the globe. I wish to take my design talents and use them to create positive change worldwide.</dd>

	<dt>Plan of Action</dt>
	<dd>I plan on creating solutions for design problems in every industry, not just traditional media. I wish to step foot into the industrial, medicinal, architechtural and business world to provide them all with innovative design ideas that will revolutionize their industry.</dd>

	<dt>Let's do it</dt>
	<dd>It doesn't take much to change to world and the more people working together towards positive change the better. Do you have an idea or problem that could use some creative power? Together we can make any design challenge a succesful reality. </dd>

	<dt>Join Me</dt>
	<dd>I would love to hear from you.</dd>
